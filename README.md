# 📊 Smartwatches Consumer Analysis Project

## About the Project  
This project is part of my Business Analytics study. The main purpose of this analysis is to understand **consumer preferences and buying behavior** toward smartwatches.  
I used **market segmentation** and **conjoint analysis** to identify which product features, price levels, and brand factors influence the purchase decisions of smartwatch users.

The project helps to find out what kind of smartwatch features different consumer groups value more and how companies can design better marketing or product strategies.

## Objective  
The key goal is to investigate:
- What features (like **health tracking, connectivity, design, brand, price**) affect customer choices.  
- How consumer preferences are different among segments (for example, **tech-savvy buyers**, **first-time users**, **budget-focused consumers**).  
- What is the **best smartwatch profile** that meets most user expectations.

## Methodology  

### 1. Qualitative Interviews  
Six in-depth interviews were conducted to collect insights about:
- Health and fitness tracking importance  
- Connectivity (Bluetooth, NFC)  
- Design preference (sporty or minimalist)  
- Brand trust and price expectation

- ### 2. Conjoint Experimental Design  
A choice-based conjoint experiment was developed using **Excel (VBA)** to create 12 smartwatch profiles based on different combinations of attributes and levels.

| Attribute | Levels |
|------------|---------|
| Health Features | Basic / Comprehensive |
| Connectivity | Standard / Enhanced (with NFC) |
| Design | Minimalist / Sporty |
| Brand | Google Fitbit / Apple |
| Price | €199 / €249 / €399 |

### 3. Segmentation Analysis  
Using **SPSS**, I performed **K-Means Cluster Analysis** to identify distinct consumer groups.  
Four main segments were found:

1. **Budget-Conscious Young Males** – prefer low price and sporty design.  
2. **First-Time Buyers** – want simplicity and affordable smartwatch.  
3. **Tech-Savvy Upgraders** – prefer advanced health features and Apple brand.  
4. **Young Fitness Enthusiasts** – active users, mid-tier price, focus on durability.  
Regression analysis was used to test attribute importance and model fit.

## Key Findings  
- **Price** is the most influential factor (≈60% importance).  
- **Enhanced connectivity (NFC)** is highly desired by modern consumers.  
- **Brand trust** (especially Apple and Google Fitbit) strongly affects preference.  
- **Health features** are expected but not always a differentiator.  
- Best preferred product profile:  
  **Comprehensive Health Tracking + Enhanced Connectivity + Sporty Design + Apple Brand + €199**
